            TypeScript (abbreviated as TS) is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.[6]
            TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js, Deno or Bun). Multiple options are available for transpilation. The default TypeScript Compiler can be used,[7] or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.
            TypeScript supports definition files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, much like C++ header files can describe the structure of existing object files. This enables other programs to use the values defined in the files as if they were statically typed TypeScript entities. There are third-party header files for popular libraries such as jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js library modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript.[8]
            The TypeScript compiler is itself written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript.[9][10][11][12]

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
      TypeScript was released to the public in October 2012, with version 0.8, after two years of internal development at Microsoft.[13][14] Soon after the initial public release, Miguel de Icaza praised the language itself, but criticized the lack of mature IDE support apart from Microsoft Visual Studio, which was not available on Linux and macOS at the time.[15][16] As of April 2021 there is support in other IDEs and text editors, including Emacs, Vim, WebStorm, Atom[17] and Microsoft's own Visual Studio Code.[18] TypeScript 0.9, released in 2013, added support for generics.[19]
      TypeScript 1.0 was released at Microsoft's Build developer conference in 2014.[20] Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 provided built-in support for TypeScript.[21] Further improvement were made in July 2014, when the development team announced a new TypeScript compiler, asserted to have a five-fold performance increase. Simultaneously, the source code, which was initially hosted on CodePlex, was moved to GitHub.[22]
      On 22 September 2016, TypeScript 2.0 was released, introducing several features, including the ability for programmers to optionally enforce null safety,[23] to mitigate what's sometimes referred to as the billion-dollar mistake.
      TypeScript 3.0 was released on 30 July 2018,[24] bringing many language additions like tuples in rest parameters and spread expressions, rest parameters with tuple types, generic rest parameters and so on.[25]
      TypeScript 4.0 was released on 20 August 2020.[26] While 4.0 did not introduce any breaking changes, it added language features such as Custom JSX Factories and Variadic Tuple Types.[26]
      TypeScript 5.0 was released on 16 March 2023 and included support for decorators.[27]
